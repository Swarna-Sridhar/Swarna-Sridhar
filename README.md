# 🎯 About Me

Hiii! I’m **Swarna Sridhar** — an analytical thinker with a creative edge and a passion for making operations and supply chains smarter.

With a background in Economics and hands-on experience across data analytics, procurement strategy, and project management, I love transforming messy datasets into practical insights that help businesses run better.

Whether it’s designing dashboards to spot trends, streamlining inventory processes, or finding the story hidden in the numbers, I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to build solutions that are both efficient and impactful.
